#Topic modeling with word-embedding on CT reports

This folder includes the original codes used to query MIMIC-III database, data cleaning, creating datasets (word_to_vec), and final model training and validation.
This project does not provide access to MIMIC-III database and the ipython files don't reveal raw data of the database.

This project requires minimal text preprocessing before building word_to_vec. Three models were built for topic modeling. Results of model performance were shown.
